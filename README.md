1. This is my training repository that stores applications completed during "iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp" course.
2. Each app is located on a separate branch and duplicated in the main branch.
3. Branches start from lesson 2 as the first lesson did't' contain a practical assignment.
4. UIKit/Storyboard
5. At the moment, the repository includes 8 applications:
 - Lesson 2. "I am rich" 
 - Lesson 3. "I am poor" 
 - Lesson 4. "Dicee" 
 - Lesson 5. "Magic 8 ball" 
 - Lesson 6. Part 1. "Dicee 2.0" 
 - Lesson 6. Part 2. "Calculator Layout"
 - Lesson 7. "Xylophone"
